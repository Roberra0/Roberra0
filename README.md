ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Roberra0
  * ðŸŒ± Brushing up on JS + HTML/CSS + React via The Odin Project (halfway done)!
  * ðŸ‘€ Planning to build personal projects focused on some strong beliefs around my hobbies
    * hip hop music production: music theory should not be a prerequisite to making music, and ghostwriters are a commodity. 
    * photography: finding picturesque spots should be a breeze
    * skiing: idkkk
    * social sciences & business books: if you invest 8hrs reading a book, you should retain the key takeaways months later
  * ðŸ“« hmu! <br><br>

P.S. Check out my photography!
